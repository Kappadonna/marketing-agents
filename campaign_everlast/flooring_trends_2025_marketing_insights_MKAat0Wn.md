The 8 Flooring Trends Set to Dominate 2025, According to Experts
================================================================

They're laying the groundwork for gorgeous homes.

[Trends come and go](https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/a64321318/furniture-trends-that-make-interior-designers-cringe/)—sometimes in the blink of a Pinterest scroll. One year it’s all about bold geometric tiles and high-contrast patterns, the next we’re leaning into muted tones and natural textures. But when it comes to flooring, this isn't just about chasing the latest look—it's about making a decision that quite literally lays the groundwork in your home for *years* to come.

In 2025, the shifts in flooring design preferences are subtle but significant. We’re seeing a gentle pivot from 2024’s more maximalist choices—think colorful palettes, heavy patterning, and bold statements—toward styles that are a little more grounded, versatile, and enduring.

Adam Vester, senior director of design of [Mohawk](https://www.mohawkflooring.com/our-brands), one of today’s leaders in flooring, declares, “The future of flooring will be all about warmth, natural aesthetics, and timeless, well-crafted materials.” That doesn’t mean boring; it means smart. Because your floors aren’t just a background feature—they’re the base layer of every room’s story.

This year’s biggest flooring trends blend longevity with style. There’s a resurgence of [checkerboard tile](https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/g63460579/checkerboard-design-trend/) (yes, black and white is back in a big way), the return of wall-to-wall carpeting with a luxe twist, and the ongoing obsession with [biophilic design](https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/a63570096/biophilic-design-guide/)—hello, cork, stone, and sustainable wood. We’re also seeing a move toward wide planks, warm tones, and hard-working materials like luxury vinyl plank that offer the beauty of natural wood without the maintenance headaches.

“Practicality is an important factor as well because flooring must meet the needs of the homeowner’s lifestyle. Things like quality, durability, and ease of cleaning are must-haves when it comes to choosing a flooring,” adds Hannah Nelson, manager of product management at Mohawk.

Whether you're building from scratch or giving your space a glow-up, choosing a flooring style that works for *your* lifestyle—and lasts through the many seasons of design—is key. These eight trends are more than just fleeting favorites; they’re investments in the look and feel of your home for the long haul.

Checkered Revival
-----------------

![design by the fox group. tile flooring.](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbx020122flooring-007-pc-lindsay-salazar-680a79f8b82a8.jpg?resize=980:* "design by the fox group. tile flooring.")

Whether done in marble or ceramic, checkerboard floors lend instant character and a timeless sophistication that says, “I read shelter magazines for fun.” And as a shelter magazine editor, I can confirm that black-and-white tile floors are being seen more frequently throughout the design world. They’re *so* much more than kitchen nostalgia—they're making a high-contrast impact in foyers, bathrooms, and even living spaces. They’re also incredibly photogenic. In other words, your floor is about to become the main character.

Want the look without redoing your floors? Designer Meghan Jay of [Meghan Jay Design](https://meghanjaydesign.com/) suggests “giving new life to existing flooring” with paint as a “creative, budget-friendly, and sustainable way to refresh a space and add character.”

The Carpet Comeback
-------------------

Carpet has re-entered the chat with major texture and pattern moments, especially in the form of cut and loop pile designs. According to Russ DeLozier, president of [The Carpet and Rug Institute](https://carpet-rug.org/), “carpet appears to be experiencing a long-anticipated resurgence in popularity.” Think of it as wall-to-wall luxury that feels just as good as it looks. Beyond the cozy factor, today's carpets offer serious sound insulation and warmth—a dream for anyone who hates cold morning toes.

And with the latest easy-to-clean technology, carpet is even a great option for pet owners. “We’re seeing pet-friendly carpet emerge as its own category, providing consumers with waterproof backings, odor- and snag-resistance, and even warranties against pet messes,” notes DeLozier. Don’t call it a comeback...okay, actually, do.

Living With Nature

Floors, like so many other aspects of the home, are getting the green memo. Sustainable materials like cork, natural stone, and responsibly sourced hardwoods are becoming go-tos for the eco-conscious home.

“We’re sourcing responsibly, opting for FSC-certified or reclaimed woods and low-VOC finishes that highlight the natural beauty of materials like European oak,” notes interior designer Elizabeth Ego of [Agape Design Group](https://www.agapedesigngroup.com/). “Clients today want the elegance of classic craftsmanship, but with a conscience. There’s a deeper appreciation for where materials come from and how they’re made, and that’s shaping a new era of luxury—one that’s both beautiful and mindful.” These elements bring in organic texture and grounding energy (literally), all while treading lightly on the planet.

The Power Tile Play
-------------------

Large-format tiles are having a moment, and they’re not just for ultra-modern spaces anymore. With fewer grout lines and a seamless appearance, these tiles make any room feel expansive and effortlessly elegant. Whether matte, glossy, or stone-look, laid in a pattern or streamlined, big tiles are making big impressions.

Vinyl, Reimagined
-----------------

![kitchen with vinyl flooring](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbx060122tammyrandallwood-pc-tessa-neustadt-kitchen-462-copy-680a75df794a1.jpg?resize=980:* "kitchen with vinyl flooring")

Once dismissed as the underdog of flooring, LVPs (luxury vinyl planks) are now the MVP. Today’s luxury vinyl options mimic hardwood so well, even seasoned designers have to do a double-take.

“Hyperrealistic grain patterns, along with natural lowlights and subtle color variations, will provide the next level of realism, closely mimicking the beauty of natural wood but with the added benefits of modern manufacturing techniques,” says Vester. Durable, water-resistant, and easier on the budget than natural wood, LVP proves you *can* have it all.

Golden Hour Woods
-----------------

Cool grays? We’re giving them a soft goodbye. Joyce Van Waeleghem, Mohawk’s senior director of design, calls Millennial grey and cool-tone wood looks an “outdated trend.” Forecasting that they are "being replaced by light natural and warmer wood colors.” Think honey, chestnut, and caramel coming back in a major way. These sun-kissed hues infuse spaces with comfort and timelessness, making your floors feel like a warm hug.

This color palette is also being seen in tile, with “colors of sand” being one of

[Coverings](https://www.coverings.com/), North America’s largest global showcase of ceramic tile and natural stone, top ten tile trends of 2025. “With a warm and often calming palette, the colors of sand are earnest and neutral, portraying the essence of a natural, earthy, and eco-friendly environment,” says Alena Capra, Coverings’ official spokesperson and Certified Master Kitchen and Bath Designer.

Terrazzo Forever
----------------

Speckled, chic, and oh-so-durable, terrazzo is having a well-deserved renaissance. This composite material adds personality and texture in a way few other flooring types can, with chips of marble, quartz, and glass creating a mosaic masterpiece underfoot. It’s playful yet polished. Plus, terrazzo’s wide variety and versatility mean it can span the trends listed in this forecast. Large format? You got it. Sustainable? Check. Warm Tones? Available. One could even go as far as to say, if you’re feeling brave, multicolored terrazzo tiles could be laid out in a checkerboard design.

Plank Statement

Go big *and* go home. According to Vester, “wider and longer planks will also become more common, creating a sense of openness and elegance, and allowing for greater visual continuity across spaces.” Oversized wood planks are trending for their ability to make spaces feel open, airy, and super high-end. According to their yearly member survey, [The National Wood Flooring Association](https://nwfa.org/) also found “homeowners are wanting longer, wider boards, “ while Brett Miller, VP of Technical Standards, Education, and Membership for NWFA adds, “parquet, herringbone, and chevron patterns are popular choices to add some additional flair to a room.” No matter how you lay them out, these elongated beauties reduce visual breaks and add instant sophistication to any room.
